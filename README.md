# Ambisonix
C++ speaker layout-independent 3D positional audio library

Ambisonix is an object-oriented positional audio library that gives you the ability to create realistic surround sound applications without having to conform to a particular speaker layout. The easy-to-use C++ API allows you to specify any number of sources / speakers and their positions in order to pin-point the best possible audio image for any sound system.

Ambisonix makes use of 3rd order Ambisonics technology with distance encoding and Doppler effect to deliver a true 3D audio experience.
